This work provides a complicated image processing and analysis approach for the categorisation of particles in microscope photographs. The recommended procedure combines editing, multi-stage processing, and photo file alteration to increase particle exposure. Particle segmentation and outline filtering procedures are employed to obtain significant features, and then a detailed analysis of particle sizes, locations, and aspect ratios is done. In addition to depicting the dispersion of particle sizes, a 3D scatter map includes information on the physical attributes of the particles. Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) characteristics are employed in this study's unique texture analysis approach to offer a more detailed knowledge of particle composition. Additionally, the research assesses KMeans labelling using GLCM, which depicts distinct zones inside the image. Contour analysis is carried out on edge-detected photos, and ground characteristics are created for every site that is identified. The recommended technique gives a detailed framework for identifying particles, giving essential insights for usage in biology, material science, and environmental tracking.
